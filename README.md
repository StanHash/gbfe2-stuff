# gbfe2 stuff

Random reverse-engineering garbage from a game I refer to as "gbfe2".

"gbfe2" is a Bootleg Fire Emblem Gaiden remake/port (and mandarin (I assume) translation) for the GameBoy Color made by [Waixing](https://bootleggames.fandom.com/wiki/Fuzhou_Waixing_Computer_Science_%26_Technology_Co.,LTD). The game is also known on web archives as "Sheng Huo Hui Zhang".

This game is mildly interesting. It seems reasonably faithful to the original gaiden presentation-wise but the engine seems in some ways more elaborate (map sprites are actually sprites!) and the game features some curious changes (for example: Kliff and one of either Gray or Tobin seem to be missing? Although stats for both exist in memory). This at least merits some further exploration in my opinion.

If you are not sure you have the correct ROM, I have provided [its sha1 sum](./gbfe2.sha1) you can check against.
